The curtain fell on TiDB Hackathon 2020, but hacking never stops. After two days of fierce competition, TiDB Hackathon 2020 ended up with many star projects, such as UDF (a user defined function framework based on WASM),  TiGraph (a graph database on TiDB), and zh.md (an automatic language lint tool for Chinese documents). Developers have built a rich open source ecosystem around TiDB and greatly improved TiDB's performance.

To **move things forward,** PingCAP is now launching an 8-week **TiDB Hacking Camp**, an incubation program to actually land these projects in the community.

During the camp, each participating project will be paired with a community mentor. Together they will lay out a practical landing plan for the project, which will be followed through during the camp. Each team is required to present their project progress to the community periodically. At the end of the camp, each project will be evaluated by its mentor to determine whether it is ready to graduate. All members of graduated projects will win customized TiDB gifts for their great work.

## Shortlisted projects (first batch)

### UDF

Team Name: ' or 0=0 or '

UDF is a user defined function engine. With UDF, users can write customized functions to realize complex execution logic in TiDB and directly run these functions in the database, which allows them to do more things on the TiDB platform.

### TiDE

Team Name: B.A.D

TiDE is a Visual Studio Code extension for TiDB, which allows developers to develop TiDB clusters and debug locally or remotely without knowing the internal mechanism of TiDB. It greatly improves developers' experience of developing and debugging TiDB projects.

### ching-wei

Team Name: zhangyushao

Ching-wei is a continuous integration (CI) tool which smartly reproduces bug issues in TiDB and proactively tag them before any manual efforts. The tool can also link each issue with an environment to facilitate the later manual recheck by the developer.

### zh.md

Team Name: zh.md

zh.md is a lint tool for Chinese documentation. Based on the abstract syntax trees and word segmentation, it automatically scans the documentation to diagnose existing issues and evaluate the quality. It uses statistics and NLP tools to assist writers to write style-compliant documents.

### Ti-Improve

Team Name: Ti-Improve

Ti-Improve is a test tool for TiDB. Based on AWS infrastructures, it uses S3 to store backup files, Lambda to execute specific tests, CodePipeline to schedule the execution, CloudWatch to observe TiDB's performance, and Chaos Mesh® to inject faults.
