Today, we are thrilled to announce the beta release of TiDB Cloud, the fully-managed [TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v4.0/overview) service delivered by [PingCAP](https://pingcap.com/). TiDB Cloud is the easiest, most economical, and most resilient way to unlock the full power of TiDB in the cloud, allowing the users to deploy and run TiDB clusters with just a few clicks.

## TiDB as you know, ready for cloud

TiDB is the industry-leading open-source, NewSQL, [hybrid transactional and analytical processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_transactional/analytical_processing) (HTAP) database in the market that's available for public, private, or hybrid cloud environments. It features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability with MySQL compatibility.

During the past 5 years, TiDB has powered the businesses of around 1,000 companies in production, during which our core team at PingCAP have accumulated a wealth of expertise in architecting, tuning, and operating a distributed database in the on-premise setting. With the user base booming and TiDB maturing, we are ready to deliver the expertise and experience to the cloud.

## Why TiDB Cloud?

TiDB Cloud is a comprehensive, fully-managed solution, where the PingCAP team will deliver a full suite of services and enterprise-grade tools to deploy, manage, maintain, backup, and upgrade a TiDB deployment for you. Optimized for mission-critical and massive-scale transactional and analytical workloads, TiDB Cloud is ideal for companies who want to get the most value out of TiDB for their specific use cases, with the least amount of operational overhead and cost. 

* Highly secure

    TiDB Cloud never asks you to choose between performance and security. TiDB Cloud secures data in dedicated networks and machines, with support for encryption both in flight and at rest.

* Cost-effective, no growing pains

    When you need to increase the database storage capacity or throughput, all you need is a few clicks on the UI, and everything will happen automatically. After the traffic peaks, TiDB Cloud helps scale in clusters and move back to the most optimal operational configuration to save costs. 

* Any cloud, no vendor lock-in

    TiDB Cloud allows its customers to use the cloud infrastructure of their choice, without fear of being locked-in by a single cloud vendor.

* Always up-to-date with the best TiDB features

    TiDB Cloud runs on the latest stable version of TiDB. You always have access to new features, performance improvements, and fixes. 

* Around-the-clock support

    When you use TiDB Cloud, you'll be supported 24/7 by the same experts that have made TiDB the preferred database for many finance, e-commerce, SaaS, and social network platforms.

## Availability

TiDB Cloud is immediately available on Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with more cloud provider support in the works.
