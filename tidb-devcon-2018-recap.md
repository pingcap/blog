On January 20th, 2018, a chilly Saturday in the middle of the winter, more than 200 coders, hackers, and techies streamed into Garage Café, a chic coffee shop in the heart of Beijing's techhub, Zhongguancun. They weren't there to get coffee. They weren't there to stay warm. They were there to be part of TiDB DevCon 2018, a technology party for the developers, by the developers.

## TiDB 1.1 Alpha Release

On January 19th, one day before DevCon, [TiDB 1.1 Alpha](https://pingcap.com/docs/releases/11alpha/) was released with the following improvements:

### Performance & latency

* Average QPS of TiDB increased by 50%.
* To support requirement from [Toutiao](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/toutiao), [TiDB 1.1 Alpha](https://pingcap.com/docs/releases/11alpha/) is able to scale auto-increment ID and achieve 16x speed improvement for queries like  `alter table t shard_row_id_bits = 4` and is also able to handle millions of TPS.
* Read QPS speed of TiKV improved by 2x.
* Counting table is now 70% faster than the previous version.
* Hash-join is 3 times faster than the previous version.
* Some complex queries using index are now more than 10x faster than the previous version.
* Cost based optimizer (CBO) is smarter.
* Loading data using the following statement is now 15x faster: `load data local infile 'output.csv' into table xxx;`

### TiDB Lightning

With TiDB Lightning, it takes less than 5 hours to import 1 TB of raw SQL file from MySQL to TiDB--10x faster than before.

## Tools and Ecosystem

### TiDB deployment

Deploying a TiDB cluster is much easier than ever before. Developers can use Docker Compose to launch a local TiDB cluster with one command on their laptops and play around with it. Moreover, the container-based components of TiDB managed by a special software named tidb-operator can be simply deployed and maintained on a Kubernetes environment in production.

### Import & Export Tools

#### TiDB Syncer

TiDB Syncer is a smart tool to migrate data from MySQL to TiDB in real time. It poses as a MySQL secondary and listens to the changes of primary by parsing the MySQL Binary Logs, and replaying the changes sequentially on the TiDB instance.

#### TiDB Binlog

TiDB Binlog is a tool designed to help users to synchronize data to downstream database in real-time. For example, users can use TiDB binlog to synchronize data from one TiDB instance to another as a Hot-backup cluster. In addition, TiDB Binlog can also be used for other purposes, such as incremental backup,  message triggering and subscription or driving stream computing and analytics.

* Web UI dashboard
* Multi-source and destination configuration
* Distributed scheduling
* Sharding source supported
* Pre-checking
* Lightweight ETL in real-time
* Cloud DB integration with:
  * AliCloud RDS

### TiDB Insight

TiDB Insight provides users with a real-time visualization and overview into the region distribution, leader regions status, hotspots, region & leader transfer, traffic flow, and the health of the entire cluster.

### Monitoring & Alerting

The TiDB monitoring system collects metrics from TiDB cluster and is integrated with Grafana to visualize data. Alerts are defined based on Prometheus's flexible query language. And the alerting system can keep users informed of any abnormal status in their TiDB cluster via email, SMS, Slack messages, or other customized ways.
