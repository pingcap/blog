# PingCAP Plants its Seed in Silicon Valley

From day one, PingCAP was conceived and built to be a global technology company with global impact. With the [GA 1.0 release](https://pingcap.com/blog/2017-10-17-announcement/) of its flagship product [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) in October 2017, PingCAP has gained significant adoption in the APAC region from leading companies like [Mobike](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mobike) and [Gaea](http://www.gaea.com/en/). Opening a Silicon Valley office is a natural progression of its growth trajectory. 

*"Even before we wrote the first line of code, we wanted the impact of our vision to be global. That’s why we adopted the open source way from the beginning,"* said Max Liu, co-founder and CEO. *“I’m thrilled to be taking our first of many steps in pursuit of that mission.”*

With a physical presence in Silicon Valley, PingCAP plans to aggressively drive product adoption in the U.S., build a strong local community of developers and contributors, and recruit a team of top-notch engineers and evangelists to further develop and raise awareness of its products.
