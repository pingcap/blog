[TiDB](http://bit.ly/tidb_repo_publication) is an open-source distributed Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database built by PingCAP, powering companies to do real-time data analytics on live transactional data in the same data warehouse -- minimize ETL, no more T+1, no more delays. More than 200 companies are now using TiDB in production. Its 2.0 version was launched in late April 2018 (read about it in [this blog post](http://bit.ly/tidb_2_0)).

In this 5-minute tutorial, we will show you how to spin up a standard TiDB cluster using Docker Compose on your local computer, so you can get a taste of its hybrid power, before using it for work or your own project in production. A standard TiDB cluster includes TiDB (MySQL compatible stateless SQL layer), [TiKV](http://bit.ly/tikv_repo_publication) (a distributed transactional key-value store where the data is stored), and [TiSpark](https://github.com/pingcap/tispark) (an Apache Spark plug-in that powers complex analytical queries within the TiDB ecosystem).

Ready? Let's get started!

## Setting Up

Before we start deploying TiDB, we'll need a few things first: `wget`, Git, Docker, and a MySQL client. If you don't have them installed already, here are the instructions to get them.

## Spin up a TiDB cluster

Now that Docker is set up, let's deploy TiDB!

1. Clone TiDB Docker Compose onto your laptop:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-docker-compose
    ```

2. Optionally, you can use `docker-compose pull` to get the latest Docker images.
3. Change your directory to `tidb-docker-compose`:

    ```bash
    cd tidb-docker-compose
    ```

4. Deploy TiDB on your laptop:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

You can see messages in your terminal launching the default components of a TiDB cluster: 1 TiDB instance, 3 TiKV instances, 3 Placement Driver (PD) instances, Prometheus, Grafana, 2 TiSpark instances (one primary, one secondary), and a TiDB-Vision instance.

Your terminal will show something like this:

![Setting Up the TiDB cluster using Docker Compose](media/setting_up_the_tidb_cluster_using_docker_compose.png)

**Congratulations! You have just deployed a TiDB cluster on your laptop!**

To check if your deployment is successful:

* Go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to launch Grafana with default user/password: admin/admin.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > If you are deploying TiDB on a remote machine rather than a local PC, go to `http://<remote host's IP address>:3000` instead to access the Grafana monitoring dashboard.

  * Go to `Home` and click on the pull down menu to see dashboards of different TiDB components: TiDB, TiKV, PD, entire cluster.

  * You will see a dashboard full of panels and stats on your current TiDB cluster. Feel free to play around in Grafana, e.g. `TiDB-Cluster-TiKV`, or `TiDB-Cluster-PD`.

![Grafana display of TiKV metrics](media/grafana_display_of_tikv_metrics.png)

<div class="caption-center"> Grafana display of TiKV metrics </div>

* Now go to TiDB-vision at [http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010) (TiDB-vision is a cluster visualization tool to see data transfer and load-balancing inside your cluster).

  * You can see a ring of 3 [TiKV](http://bit.ly/tikv_repo_publication) nodes. TiKV applies the Raft consensus protocol to provide strong consistency and high availability. Light grey blocks are empty spaces, dark grey blocks are Raft followers, and dark green blocks are Raft leaders. If you see flashing green bands, that represent communications between TiKV nodes.

  * It looks something like this:

## Test TiDB compatibility with MySQL

As we mentioned, TiDB is MySQL compatible. You can use TiDB as MySQL secondaries with instant horizontal scalability. That's how many innovative tech companies, like [Mobike](https://pingcap.com/case-studies/tidb-in-mobike), use TiDB.

To test out this MySQL compatibility:

1. Keep the `tidb-docker-compose` running, and launch a new Terminal tab or window.

2. Add MySQL to the path (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin
    ```

3. Launch a MySQL client that connects to TiDB:

    ```sql
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000  -u root
    ```

**Result:** You will see the following message, which shows that TiDB is indeed connected to your MySQL instance:

> Note: TiDB version number may be different.

```bash
Server version: 5.7.10-TiDB-v2.0.0-rc.4-31
```

## Let's get some data!

Now we will grab some sample data that we can play around with.

1. Open a new Terminal tab or window and download the `tispark-sample-data.tar.gz` file.

    ```bash
    wget http://download.pingcap.org/tispark-sample-data.tar.gz
    ```

2. Unzip the sample file:

    ```bash
    tar zxvf tispark-sample-data.tar.gz
    ```

3. Inject the sample test data from sample data folder to MySQL:

    ```bash
    cd tispark-sample-data
    ./sample_data.sh
    ```

    This will take a few seconds.

4. Go back to your MySQL client window or tab, and see what's in there:

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

    **Result:** You can see the `TPCH_001` database on the list. That's the sample data we just ported over.

    ![Imported data](media/imported_data.png)

    Now let's go into `TPCH_001`:

    ```sql
    USE TPCH_001;
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

    **Result:** You can see all the tables in `TPCH_001`, like `NATION`, `ORDERS`, etc.

5. Let's see what's in the `NATION` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM NATION;
    ```

**Result:** You'll see a list of countries with some keys and comments.

![The records in the NATION table](media/the_records_in_the_nation_table.png)

## Launch TiSpark

Now let's launch TiSpark, the last missing piece of our hybrid database puzzle.

1. In the same window where you downloaded TiSpark sample data (or open a new tab), go back to the `tidb-docker-compose` directory.

2. Launch Spark within TiDB with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec tispark-master  /opt/spark/bin/spark-shell
    ```

    This will take a few minutes.

    **Result:** Now you can Spark!

    ![Now you can Spark](media/now_you_can_spark.png)

3. Use the following command to set `TPCH_001` as default database:

    ```bash
    spark.sql("use TPCH_001")
    ```

    It looks something like this:
    ![Bind TiSpark to this Spark instance](media/bind_tispark_to_this_spark_instance.png)

4. Now, let's see what's in the `NATION` table (should be the same as what we saw on our MySQL client):

    ```java
    spark.sql("select * from nation").show(30);
    ```

    **Result:**

    ![What's in the NATION table in Spark](media/whats_in_the_nation_table_in_spark.png)

## Let's get hybrid!

Now, let's go back to the MySQL tab or window, make some changes to our tables, and see if the changes show up on the TiSpark side.

1. In the MySQL client, try this `UPDATE`:

    ```sql
    UPDATE NATION SET N_NATIONKEY=444 WHERE N_NAME="CANADA";
    SELECT * FROM NATION;
    ```

2. Then see if the update worked:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM NATION;
    ```

3. Now go to the TiSpark Terminal window, and see if you can see the same update:

    ```java
    spark.sql("select * from nation").show(30);
    ```

    **Result:** The `UPDATE` you made on the MySQL side shows up immediately in TiSpark!

    ![The same result is showing on both the MySQL client and TiSpark Client](media/the_same_result_is_showing_on_both_the_mysql_client_and_tispark_client.png)

You can see that both the MySQL and TiSpark clients return the same results -- fresh data for you to do analytics on right away. Voila!

## Summary

With this simple deployment of TiDB on your local machine, you now have a functioning Hybrid Transactional and Analytical processing (HTAP) database. You can continue to make changes to the data in your MySQL client (simulating transactional workloads) and analyze the data with those changes in TiSpark (simulating real-time analytics).

Of course, launching TiDB on your local machine is purely for experimental purposes. If you are interested in trying out TiDB for your production environment, send us a note: [info@pingcap.com](mailto:info@pingcap.com) or reach out on [our website](https://pingcap.com/). We'd be happy to help you!
